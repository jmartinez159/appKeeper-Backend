# Welcome to Application Keeper Backend
This repository is the backend to the application of Application Keeper. The server is running on an AWS EC2
instance waiting for a request sent from the frontend(web browser extension).

# How it works
The server can be started by running:
`node server.js`

If you would also like to run it on an EC2 instance visit:
